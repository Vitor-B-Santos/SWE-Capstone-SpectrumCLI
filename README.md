Robbins AFB project 3: Software Language Instructional Environment 

One disadvantage to offline training environments is the ability to quickly index or return to a particular topic. To accommodate various learning styles and preferences, the 402 SWEG is looking to develop a new learning platform to augment already existing learning environments. Objectives: - Develop a block based web environment (similar to Jupyter notebooks), that can be configured through loading of a training plan, and providing the following four blocks: markdown text block (to include video links), code block, code output block, and assignment block - Code blocks should support python, c++, and c# (only one language per session). Execution of a code block would be displayed in a code output block. - Code output blocks should display STDOUT/STDERR from execution. Compiler warnings/errors should only be displayed if code block fails to compile. - assignment blocks should contain an expected output which can be compared against a coded response providing pass/fail indication. Block should also contain ability to hide/show a correct solution. - blocks can be added, inserted, and deleted through the web interface - Saving of environment to a training plan for future distribution and reloading
