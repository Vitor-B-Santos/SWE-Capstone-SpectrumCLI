Robbins AFB project 1: Spectrum Analyzer Analysis Tool

Military Flight Test Ranges have a selection of Radio Frequency (RF) Threat Systems, both real and simulated, used for testing Aircraft Electronic Warfare (EW) Systems during flight. The Flight Test Ranges have a radar tracking station that is used to record RF transmissions of the various Threat Systems, both during test and for calibration purposes. The RF transmissions are recorded via video from a Spectrum Analyzer and are provided to the system engineers for the System Under Test (SUT) on DVD. Analysis of this data requires a system engineer to actively watch a selection of video data to verify frequency and amplitude of a specific Threat System. The 402 SWEG at Robins AFB is looking to decrease human interaction by having the information in the video data be analyzed programmatically and transcribed to a numeric format that can be digitally manipulated. Delivered application should be able to: • Recognize and process amplitude on the vertical axis and frequency on the horizontal axis from a video of a Spectrum Analyzer • Recognize and process the center frequency of a signal and the amplitude of that signal peak (tracking the minimum and maximum amplitudes, as well as providing an average amplitude) from a video of a Spectrum Analyzer o Threshold: Recognize and process a single RF signal o Objective: Recognize and process multiple RF signals from a single video • Store the processed frequency (center) and amplitude (minimum, maximum, and average) information in a CSV formatted file for each detected signal at the signal peak
